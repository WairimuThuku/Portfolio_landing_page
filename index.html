            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Growing up near the airport and with the exposure of aircrafts, i developed an interest in the aviation field! After high school I pursued pilot training at the Wilson Airport and graduated with a PPL(private pilot licence) I later joined JKUAT university for my degree in Information Technology but later dropped since i was not seeing value for my money. Along side that I've worked at a baby shop as a sales person, I've also worked with a private company in fixing CCTVs and laptops, I've also styled and sold mens wear.
              As a pilot student, i noticed lots of loop holes whe it comes to the aviation industry and this led to me having a desire to do programming and developing apps that can at least help curb the problem. </p>
